mmesh has two types of users:

- The account administrator, considered as the account owner.
- Normal users.

There is no limit in the number of normal users you can create.

#### Administration

You can manage the users using the mmesh webUI or the mmesh CLI.

Browse the [IAM: Users Administration](/docs/mmesh/administration/iam-users) section to learn how to manage the users.
